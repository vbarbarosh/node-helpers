## Docs

General idea of organizing docs:

- The main goal of docs is to be more cookbook rather than plain reference
  manual
- Each function should have its own .md file
- There should be an index of each available function
- Ideally, it should be a single page with a sidebar with all functions at
  right, and the main body taking the rest of the space
- At the top should be a search input, just a filter of available functions
